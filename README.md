# What is this?

This is mostly just a project for me to get familiarized with HTML5. 

It is a simple NPuzzle demo, nothing more.

# How to use?

(disclaimer, this is just a project for my self-learning, so sorry if the instructions seemed vague.)

What happens when I filled the board:
* If everything is correct, '^_^' will display at the top center.
* If there is something incorrect '-_-' wiill display at the top center.


Buttons at the top:
* '@' button will RESTART the board
* '!' button will give you a new board
